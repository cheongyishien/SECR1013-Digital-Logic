# SECR1013-Digital-Logic
**Lecturer: Mr. Ahmad Fariz bin Ali**

Reflection on course

The Digital Logic course has provided the understanding of how digital circuits function and how binary systems are used to represent information.The fundamental tools such as boolean algebra and logic gates are helpful to design and analyze digital circuit.Through the study of combinational and sequential circuits, a deeper understanding was developed for how digital systems process and store data. In short, a strong analytical and problem-solving skills are developed.
